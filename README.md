# ownCloud: Testing

This repository documents the currently available test suites and how to use them based on local or remote instances of ownCloud. Beside that we also provide a Docker image that wraps parts of the test suites, this is a work in progress and doesn't cover all cases yet. You can see a list of available test suites below:

* [Litmus](litmus/)
* [Smashbox](smashbox/)
